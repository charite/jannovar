/** Helper class for checking a {@link GenotypeCalls} for compatibility with a pedigree and mitochondrial inheritance
	*
	* <h2>Compatibility Check</h2>
	*
	* In the case of a single individual, we require merely that a variant is located on the mitochondrion.
	*
	* In the case of multiple individuals, we require that all affecteds have the called variant and that there is
 	* is no transmission from an affected father to children (this would mean that the case is definitely not related
 	* to a mitochondrial mutation, whatever the distribution of variants may be!).
 * <P>
 *     Note that mitochondrial inheritance is considered to be Nonmendelian, so that this class is named
 *     {@code InheritanceCheckerMT} rather than {@code MendelianCheckerMT} as the other classes in this package.
 * </P>
