/**
 * Implements an Interval Tree.
 * <P>
 * The construction of the interval tree proceeds in several phases.
 * <ol>
 * <li>The 2n endpoints are sorted for the n intervals and the median point of the endpoints is calculated.
 * <li>The intervals are divided into three categories.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Intervals that cross the median are stored in the intervals list.
 * <li>Intervals completely to the left of the median are stored in the leftNode list.
 * <li>Intervals completely to the right are stored in the rightNode list.
 * </ol>
 * <li>Each interval in the intervals list is sorted in two lists: leftorder (sorted by increasing left endpoints) and
 * rightorder (sorted by decreasing right endpoints).
 * </ol>
 * Note that a Node object may have non-null right and left children while the Node itself has not associated intervals,
 * depending on the relationship of the median value to the values of the intervals.
 * <P>
 * To search in the interval tree, the following procedure is used.
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the highpoint of the interval is smaller than the median, the right subtree is eliminated. Otherwise, the
 * search method is called recursively.
 * <li>If the lowpoint of the interval is larger than the median, the left subtree is eliminated. Otherwise, the search
 * method is called recursively.
 * <li>Always searches the intervals stored at current node using the two sorted lists leftorder and rightorder.
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the highpoint is smaller than the median, search the leftorder list and output all intervals until there is
 * one with a left endpoint larger than the lowpoint.
 * <li>If the lowpoint is larger than the median, search the rightorder list and output all intervals until there is one
 * with a right endpoint smaller than the highpoint.
 * </ol>
 * </ol>
 * <P>
 * A slight modification of the search algorithm is made to search for the left and right neighbors of search queries
 * that do not overlap with any intervals. We make essentially a binary-tree type search using the medians of the nodes.
 * Each time we pass a node, we check whether we can update the neihgbors. One issue is that we have to make special
 * compensation when we update using a node with no intervals on its own.
 * <P>
 * The construction of an Interval Tree enables a fast search of overlapping intervals.
